In the fall of 2023, another parent and myself founded a <drumroll> Music school!

We have an arrangment with the Snow Valley Christian Fellowship church to be able to rent
their building, which by the way is full of musical instruments! In the sanctuary there is
a drumset, grand piano, two Roland keyboards, a bass, a guitar amp, and a full PA system with monitors set up and ready to go! It's really quick to walk in there, turn a few things on,
and start rocking out with the kiddos School of Rock style! In addition there are multiple
pianos in the basement in individual rooms suitable for private lessons.

We organized our school as a not for profit society in the province of British Columbia in early 2024.
For those who live outside of BC, "society" is a legal term here that means "not for profit".

We live in a small town that has limited extracurricular music opportunities for kids. Its
important that we do this to help fill in opportunities. Currently we run "terms" usually one
or two 6 to 9 week sessions per year.

Our typical offering of courses includes:

* intro to music for the 4 - 6 age range
* jam bands and keyboard clubs for ages 7 - 14
* and kids choir, all ages.

## update 2024 January 26

It's going well. We've been operating for about two years now. We've had two sucessful recitals.
The most recent one had about a dozen different acts and the kids performed so well,
I was very impressed. It's so much fun to work with the kids, and inspiring to see them progress.
